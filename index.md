## *Who am I?*
I'm a third year, Math-CS major. I've spent the last few years establishing a
base in mathematics, computer science, and software engineering. 

## Professional Experience
I've had a software engineering internship at a robotics company, 
CloudMinds Technology, and another one at Amazon under their Amazon Game Studios
(AGS) org.

My professional experience has been a lot of game development. Obviously at AGS
but also in CloudMinds where I worked on some experimental features of 
simulating their irl robots in Unreal Engine.

## Personal Projects
Outside of professional projects, I enjoy coming up with ideas for apps/websites
etc and bringing them to life. I find working on these projects with a team is 
great!

Knowing that I can materialize an idea to a working product is empowering for me
and I like to work on long term projects that give me an opportunity to do so.

In my first project, I created **Tally**, a classroom management app for 
teachers. It took me over 9 months and I was able to deploy and have a working
demo which I got to show to recruiters. I learned the basics of web develeopment
and got a ton of experience in back-end development, modeling data in relational
database, authentication, and deployment. This app indirectly got me an
internship at Amazon.

In my most recent project, I'm working on an advertising service. Since the idea
is still in development, I'll leave it unnamed. This has been my most involved
project till date and I've had the chance to lead a team of 5 other people on
it. With this project, I designed the architecture and tackled front-end 
development while letting others work on some of the back-end and database.
**_We're hoping to launch soon!_**

## Outside of Academics and Career

### Hobbies and Passions
- **Working out:** I workout 5 to 6 days a week. It's helped me build a routine and stay mentally
and physically healthy. I've also met some life long friends along the way.

- **Videography:** I've been filming and editing videos for the last 9 years. lately with covid,
I've gotten more into editing.
