## *Who am I?*
I'm a fourth-year, Math and Computer Science student at UC San Diego. 
I work on design and software engineering.

## Professional Experience
I spent my first summer at UCSD interning at CloudMinds Technology,
a robotics company, migrating their codebase in Unity for
simulating and encoding our robots' movement to Unreal Engine.

My second summer I worked for Amazon on New World, a MMORPG game
where I improved the immersiveness of the game by allowing players
to interact with cosmetic objects in the game world. 

Currently I'm working at Ascension, a health-care company based on
the east coast.

## Personal Projects

the app and hosted a beta on Apple's TestFlight. I was able to explore the basics of web 
develeopment working on things like modeling data in a relational database, 
implementing authentication, and deploying the app on Google Cloud Platform.

The next project I worked on was called AdBot, an advertising platform for Discord.
This project allowed me to

## Outside of Academics and Career

### Hobbies and Passions
- **Weight-lifting:** I workout 5 to 6 days a week. It's helped me build a routine
and stay mentally and physically healthy. I've also met some life long friends 
along the way.

- **Videography:** I've been filming and editing videos for the last 9 years. 
Artistic aspect aside, it's been interesting seeing how similar the process is
deliverving a video to delivering code.
